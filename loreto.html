    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Project Loreto is a cutting-edge hybrid drone engineered to operate seamlessly in both air and water environments. Inspired by the legendary House of Loreto, miraculously carried by angels, this project symbolizes the union of faith, flight, and innovation.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools & Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom hybrid drone frame (air + water capable)</li>
      <li>Brushless motors + ESCs for aerial propulsion</li>
      <li>Water jet thrusters or propellers for aquatic motion</li>
      <li>FPV camera + control system</li>
      <li>Battery management system for dual-mode operation</li>
      <li>Control software with seamless mode switching</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      The design phase is underway, with CAD modeling and component selection in progress. Key challenges include weight balancing, waterproofing, and transitioning between flight and aquatic movement. Prototyping will begin soon, with early tests planned for both pool and open-air environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Photos</h2>
    <p>Coming soon: concept renders, design sketches, and build progress photos.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      The next development steps include finalizing the mechanical design, sourcing key components, and assembling a first functional prototype. Once built, we’ll test the drone’s transition mechanics, waterproofing integrity, and control responsiveness.
