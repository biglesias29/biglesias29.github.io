    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This project began as a simple ride-on toy car but was reimagined into a rugged support vehicle for a child with disabilities. The goal was to provide him with greater independence and mobility while maintaining safety and control. To accomplish this, we reprogrammed the system to accept both a physical foot pedal and input from an RC transmitter. Using a servo-based override, the caregiver can switch between manual and remote operation, offering flexibility based on the environment or situation. The entire system was upgraded with dual ESCs and reinforced electronics to handle rough terrain while still being responsive and accessible. This vehicle isn’t just fun—it serves a real purpose for families who need adaptive mobility options for their kids.

    <h2>Tools & Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 × 18V Power Tool Batteries (wired in parallel)</li>
      <li>Hobbywing QuicRun 880 Dual-Motor ESC (rear motors)</li>
      <li>Radiolink CL9030 ESC (steering motor)</li>
      <li>RC Transmitter + Physical Pedal Control</li>
      <li>Servo disconnect system for manual/RC control switch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Upgrade</h2>
    <p>
      We replaced the old onboard “computer” and its limited remote with a more reliable and responsive RC transmitter and receiver system.
      The new setup offers better range, smoother control, and easier pairing. Steering and throttle are now fully mapped to the new remote, and the vehicle toggles seamlessly between manual and RC control using a servo-based disconnect.

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
      The vehicle works reliably and is capable of supporting over 500 lbs. It features a RC toggle switch, hot swappable batteries, extended range.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      The next step is to design a cleaner control interface by fully removing the old shifting hardware. I’m also planning to add a screen mount and night lights for visibility, along with a detachable hitch.
      I'm currently exploring more compact ESC options and a modular mounting solution for the electronics inside the body.
